    You have an array containing unsorted integers.
    Write a JavaScript function to find the second largest element in this array. 
    The function should meet the following conditions:

        Do not use any built-in sorting functions like sort().
        The time complexity of the operation should be O(n).
        The function should return null if the array contains fewer than two distinct elements.

    Can you write this function?
